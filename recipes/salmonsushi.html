        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            What is Salmon Sushi? This is a simple dish from Japan in which salmon is placed on top of glutinous rice wrapped in seaweed.
            Salmon sushi is simple ingredients-wise, but making it takes a lot of practice to get right. Salmon sushi can be eaten with
            wasabi if you're a masochist.
